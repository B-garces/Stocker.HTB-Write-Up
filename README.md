Write up Report for the HackTheBox Machine Stocker
Stocker HTB Writeup

- Started with a Nmap scan `nmap -sV -sC 10.129.87.173`

- We get the basic two ports open `SSH` and `HTTP`. I first checked to see if there was any vulnerabilities with the services running first but nothing jumped out yet. So I went to enumerate the http server running. But first added the IP to my hosts file.

- After exploring the website the only interesting thing I was able to find was the name of the head of the IT department Angoose which maybe can come in handy later on in the machine.

- I then started the enumeration process for subdomains `gobuster vhost -u http://stocker.htb -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-topmillion-5000.txt`. Thus finding dev.stocker.htb

- Adding the new sub domain to the hosts file `sudo nano /etc/hosts`

- The new sub domain leads to a login page that I began to inspect the page to see if there was anything interesting on the front end. To figure out how the login page was working I submitted some random credentials into the login page to see what the web traffic looked like going to the server.

- Since I saw the response was looking for something in JS I changed the content type in the request to `application/json` and the login parameters to attempt a NoSQL injection using default credentials `{"username":{"$ne":"admin"}, "password":{"$ne":"pass"}}` to bypass the login to see if we get a different response from the server.

- We get a response that the request is trying to redirect to a new directory of the domain called `/stock`. Bringing us to a inventory purchasing page. Which allows us to add items to a cart submitting the purchase and getting a PDF returned to us documenting our purchase we had made.

- I then checked the request/response in BurpSuite to check what was happening when clicking on submit purchase within the window.

- After doing some research on the software that was executing the PDF file I find that it was vulnerable to XSS and allows us to exploit it by making it run a script to read a local file on the web sever running. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf

- Reading some of the information on the hacktricks website we see that if we insert a iframe or embed tag within the title field it will print the results within the PDF after executing it. Using `<embed src=file:///etc/passwd></embed>` it prints us the results of the passwd file.

- I noticed it wasnâ€™t showing all of it properly so I changed the script to change the size as well to display it properly `<embed height=1000px width=1000px src=file:///etc/passwd></embed>`

- After messing with the file paths I checked the local path that the webapp was being hosted on to display the main JS file `index.js` that was being presented within the directory. Using `<embed height=1000px width=1000px src=file:///var/www/dev/index.js></embed>` it shows some interesting things.

- We see that we have a password for a user on the system that we can start using to try to SSH into one of the users behind the web application. Since we saw very early on that `Angoose` was the head of the IT department and one of the users that showed after displaying the `passwd` file we can try his username first with the password we found. After exploring the users home folder we find our first flag.

- Now I continue enumerating to get the root flag of the machine with `sudo -l`

- We now see we can run `/usr/bin/node /usr/local/scripts/*.js` as root which we can start exploring options to exploit as well. Since we can run any Java Script file that we make within that path we can start making a JS file containing a exploit to become as the user root. I then went to https://gtfobins.github.io/ to see what we can do within the node binary to spawn as root.

- We now have the JS code to implement the exploit so lets go create the JS file to run.

- After running `sudo /usr/bin/node /usr/local/scripts/../../../home/angoose/exploit.js` we spawn as the root user. Thus giving us the root flag of the machine.
